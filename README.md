# Akalath Quarantine Extreme Mode

TERA Toolbox mod which adds some few changes to AQ mechanics.

**Note: some of this stuff wasn't fully tested, so use at your own risk** (you won't get banned or anything, but some unwanted behavior could happen during fights)

There is 1 extra mech at 1st boss, and 3 extra mechs for both bosses. Check the spoiler below to see what they are... or figure them out yourself for more fun :^).
